     * Move semantics are supported to allow transferring ownership safely.
     *
     * Typical usage includes creating a scoped_connection from a raw connection pointer
     * returned by a signal's `connect()` method, allowing the connection to be
     * automatically disconnected when the scoped_connection goes out of scope.
